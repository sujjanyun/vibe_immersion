                                <li>Tokyo began life as a village known as Edo.
                                The city that would become one of the world’s largest metropolises started out as a small fishing village, first settled around 3,000 B.C.</li>
                                <li>The Allied bombing of Tokyo was just as destructive as that of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
                                World War II-era bombing of Japan began just months after the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor, when aviator James Doolittle led his famed raid of 16 B-25 bombers on targets in Tokyo and Yokohama.

                                <li>Japan is home to the oldest monarchy in the world. Dating from approximately 660 B.C., the Imperial House of Japan has seen 125 monarchs placed on what is often known as the Chrysanthemum Throne, making it the longest lasting continuous monarchy in the world.</li>

                                <li>Shinjuku Station is the world’s busiest train station. A never-ending labyrinth of underground tunnels, shopping strips and seas of moving bodies, Shinjuku Station is a place where seasoned locals get lost on the regular.</li>
                                <li>A train went viral for being a few seconds early
                                Japan has a reputation for being an efficient nation, and the train system is one of the ways in which this reputation was made. Late last year, one particular train story went viral because one specific train departed 20 seconds early.

                                <li>Bus is the cheapest way to travel from places to places. It will take you hours but the prices are very accessible, the buses are comfortable and every 2 hours (more or less) the buses make a 15 minutes stop where you can go to the restrooms, convenience stores or just stretch your legs.</li>
