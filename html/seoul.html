            <h1>Soul Searching Seoul</h1>
            <p>Seoul (서울) is the capital of South Korea. Before, Seoul was the capital of the Korea from 1394 until the formal division of the country In 1948. With a municipal population of over 11.8 million, and a metropolitan population totaling over 25.6 million, Seoul is by far South Korea's largest city and one of East Asia's financial and cultural epicenters. Seoul also serves as the cultural, economic, business and political center of South Korea where skyscrapers towers over its buddhist temples. A fascinating blend of ancient traditions and cutting-edge digital technology, home to endless street food vendors and vast nightlife districts, an extraordinarily high-pressure educational system and serene Buddhist temples, a trend-setting youth culture and often crushing conformism, extraordinary architecture and endless monotonous rows of grey apartment buildings, Seoul is a city filled with stark contrasts.</p>

                                <li>It’s hot! Korean food is hot and spicy — one of the important ingredients being gochujang (fermented red chilli paste). Onions, garlic, scallions, ginger, sesame oil, doenjang (fermented soybean paste) and powdered red pepper are popular spices.</li>
                                <li>It is also harmonious. The strong Korean belief in eumyangohaeng (yin and yang) is reflected in its food as well, which is nutritionally balanced in terms of colours, textures and flavours. A traditional Korean table includes dishes or garnishes of five different colours to represent the earth’s five elements.</li>
                                <li>Fermented food is central to the Korean table. Gochujang, doenjang and ganjang, the three important bases of most Korean dishes, are all fermented products. Kimchi, the country’s national dish, is fermented underground for a year before consumption.</li>

                                <li>The North and South Are Still at War
                                    Although we often hear news about the possible threats from North Korea, most South Koreans don’t think much of it. While living here in South Korea, it almost feels like it’s a completely safe situation. The two Koreas may not be battling it out on a day-to-day basis, but they still haven’t made up. In the year 1953, the two sides agreed to a truce. However, as you head to the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone border) in South Korea, you’ll notice that there is still quite a bit of tension there. Despite this, South Korea is still surprisingly safe.</li>
                                <li>Over the course of the next 4 decades,  Seoul (and South Korea as a whole) entered a period of rapid economic growth that transformed it from a developing country to one of the world’s largest economies. This period is referred to as the ‘Miracle on the Han River’ – the river which Seoul is located on.
                                </li>
                                <li>In the year 18 BC, the kingdom of Baekje founded its capital city Wiryeseong (nowadays Seoul). During the reign of Joseon Dynasty, the capital of Korea was renamed to “Hanyang” and later “Hanseong”. The present name “Seoul” is believed to have originated from the Korean word for the capital city “Seoraneol”.</li>

                                <li>Seoul has an extensive network of public transportation and taxis. Consistently voted as one of the best in the world for its ease of use, cleanliness, and frequency of service, the Seoul subway system is one of the most efficient ways to travel around the city. Trains run non-stop from approximately 5:30 am until midnight.</li>
                                <li>There are a number of intra-city and inter-city buses in Korea, all with a specific system to make for organized travel. Seoul has a color coded system to help commuters make their way more efficiently. 
                                </li>
                                <li>Taxis in Seoul are an inexpensive and useful means of transportation. Abundant and inexpensive, it’s easy to flag one down on the streets, or find one of the many taxi stands located around major tourist destinations. </li>
